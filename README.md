# 🌟 Fine-Tuning Llama-2-7b for Enhanced Insights 🦙

Welcome to the repository for my project, where I fine-tuned the LLM model, Llama-2-7b, to provide enhanced insights into the **2024 Indian Elections** 🇮🇳 and the **Rajkot TRP Game Zone fire accident** 🔥.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates significant improvements in Llama-2-7b's ability to respond with nuanced insights after fine-tuning. By training the model on specific datasets related to real-world events, we achieved substantial performance enhancements in the model’s predictions and response accuracy.

## 🔍 Data Collection & Training Process

- **Data Sources**: A wide variety of online sources were used to compile a robust dataset, focusing on:
  - The Indian Election 2024 🇮🇳
  - Rajkot TRP Game Zone fire accident 🔥
- **Training**: Fine-tuned the Llama-2-7b model using the following technologies:
  - Hugging Face 🤗
  - Google Colab 🛠️
  - Torch 🔥
  - Transformers 🧩
  - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) 📉
  - Pipelines 🔄

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face**: For model and dataset management.
- **Torch**: Core deep learning framework used for training.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face’s transformer models were utilized to fine-tune the Llama-2-7b.
- **LoRA**: Implemented LoRA for efficient fine-tuning with minimal resource usage.
- **Pipelines**: For streamlining the model's outputs.

## 🌐 Real-World Impact

Fine-tuned models like **Llama-2-7b** can:
- Provide more **accurate political predictions** for upcoming elections.
- Deliver **detailed emergency information** in crisis situations, improving decision-making during accidents like the TRP Game Zone fire.

## 📊 Results

The fine-tuned model exhibits the following improvements:
- Enhanced context understanding for event-specific data.
- More accurate and relevant responses to queries about the election and the fire incident.
